This is the second analysis that I do on a dataset from a gaming marketplace. In the first analysis, we studied Steam games, in this project we are going to carry out a similar analysis on the Google Play Store. The structure of the analysis will be similar to the one we follow in the Steam project. In this way we can carry out a comparative analysis between the two platforms.

ABOUT THE DATASET

The original dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps. The dataset used in this analysis includes information about all the apps available in the Google Play Store, not just games. To focus solely on games, we carried out a cleanup process to filter out all non-game apps. We also removed any null values and duplicate entries and created new columns to better suit our analysis. Additionally, we adjusted information from existing columns to ensure that our dataset was optimized for our specific analysis of the Google Play Store game marketplace.
The cleaning process can be found at: https://github.com/manumg/10-Years-of-Google/blob/main/GOOGLE%20CLEANING.ipynb
